TO_FIX:
* [RESOLVED]AddNewDeputyViewController will crash on device, complaining 'modifying layer that is being finalized - 0x473510'
  A: trying to release some autorelease object in that VC.
  
* 


(from bottom to top)



>  Create a detailed view (stacked vc) to dig the data (with local analyse)
    > try out different solution of interactive art/design/solutions

>  Create a data filter bar to filter data (similar to the area selection like 'Dianping HD')
    > ...


? Research and Design the interaction first before writing any code. See what info. is important to track and present.

> Create a profile vc for showing basic data
    > drag/slide animation to allow retreat, similar to dianping HD's biz detail info

> Create a server backend to start programming for remote login
    >



>  Show existing deputy data on the mapview   
    > CHANGE: the annotation should display only aggregate data, when callout, list the current nominees/elected rows
    > NOTE: during the developing, the deputy annotation can be displaced in potential two ways:
            * user current location
            * the geometrical center of the nominee area/organization, which are aggregated info from multiple app users!!!
            
    > [DONE] record GPS lat and lng for AddNewDeputyVC         
    > show user current location ( to allow dummy data to be aggregated, collect)  ^^^__^^^!
    
    > can auto zoom to the correctscalea
    > can aggregate data and show correct annotations
    
    > use modal view to config display of the map. e.g. satellite/road



>  create a data entry vc for input
    > use popoverview and area picker, and interactions/data
    > use CouchCocoa lib

>  create a mapview for background, later for mkannotation
